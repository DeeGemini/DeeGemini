<!-- About Me Section -->
### 🚀 About Me
- 🌱 I began my software engineering journey with ALX, where I discovered my passion for Backend Development
- 💡 I'm inspired by software and IoT ideas I have had over the years, which motivated me to learn programming so I could bring them to life
- 🎯 My goal is to create impactful software solutions that address real-world challenges. Looking to the future, I aspire to establish a platform dedicated to nurturing young, emerging developers-especially graduates and post-graduates. By building my own company, I hope to offer them real-world experience and opportunities to grow, helping shape the next generation of tech innovators
- 🔭 I'm currently working on the Multi-Device Call Tool project which allows users to use a single phone number across multiple devices. And I am also focusing on strengthening my JS and Node.js skills, and mastering PWAs (Progressive Web Apps)
